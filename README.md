Muni Minutes 2.0
================

## Overview

This is my second attempt at a train-arrival indicator. It uses a [Particle
Core](https://store.particle.io/?product=spark-core) and the associated web
services to display arrival times on a gauge.

## The Future
* have the device request arrival times from a central service.
* mount the gauge in a wall-hanging of the front of a muni train.
* add LEDs for lighting up when time is running short.
